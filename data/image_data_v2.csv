ngc1850-blue,NGC 1850,"This Hubble image shows a stunning globular star cluster known as NGC 1850, with observations in visible and near-infrared light. NGC 1850 is about 100 million years old and is located about 160,000 light-years away within the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to our home Milky Way. Like most globular clusters, NGC 1850 is a roughly spherical group of stars held together by their mutual gravitational attraction. However, unlike most globular clusters, its stars are relatively young.",A nearly spherical gathering of white stars shines at center top of the image. A blue gas cloud extends from top left to center bottom.,https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/52515250436/in/photolist-TqJHPv-25HQT1j-27oj5rj-2o1Aomm-2o1Dk4R-2ojsRGC,,0.7,582,2,0
ngc4535,NGC 4535,"NGC 4535 is a spiral galaxy located about 50 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. The bright-blue colors in the spiral arms show the presence of younger, hotter stars, while the more yellow core suggests that the galaxy’s central area is mostly home to older and cooler stars. Despite the incredible quality of this Hubble image, the galaxy can appear ghostly and faint when viewed with a smaller telescope – which earned it the nickname of the “Lost Galaxy”.","A massive spiral galaxy fills the image, with a bright yellow core surrounded by winding arms laced with dark brown dust and blue stars. A few foreground stars shine throughout.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/50863460542/in/photolist-2kuCwLf-2nib24y,,0.9,686,2,0
ngc3603,NGC 3603,"A glittering collection of young stars shines in this Hubble view of NGC 3603. This cluster of huge, hot stars is surrounded by clouds of interstellar gas and dust – the raw material for new star formation. Ultraviolet radiation and violent stellar winds from these stars have blown out an enormous cavity into this gas and dust.","A densely packed cluster of yellow stars shines at the center of the image, with more stars scattered throughout. Clouds of glowing indigo gas and dust dominate the lower half of the view, and a red star with diffraction spikes shines at upper right.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/42247344914/in/album-72157698290709165,could clean stars better,0.9,934,2,0
ngc4689,NGC 4689,"This Hubble image shows the jewel-bright spiral galaxy NGC 4689, located about 54 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices. This image includes data from two sets of Hubble observations in 2019 and 2024. Both observing programs aimed to observe multiple, relatively nearby galaxies.","A close-up view of a spiral galaxy fills most of the scene. It has a bright, glowing spot at its core, broad spiral arms that hold many dark threads of dust, and pink glowing spots across the disk that mark areas of star formation. A faint halo that bleeds into the dark background surrounds the galaxy’s disk.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/53744157265/in/photolist-2jrotoU-2pTbRx8,,0.7,246,1,0
acos295,ACO S 295,"This packed Hubble image shows a whole cluster of galaxies known as ACO S 295, in addition to a crowd of background galaxies and foreground stars. Galaxies of many shapes and sizes populate the view, ranging from spirals to fuzzy elliptical galaxies. The cluster’s huge mass has gravitationally lensed the light from background galaxies – meaning that light coming from behind ACO S 295 gets magnified and warped, seen as the “smeared” lines of light in this image.","Several galaxies shine against black space. These galaxies range in shape and size, but are mostly yellow in tone. A larger blueish spiral galaxy shines just right of the image’s center, along with a few foreground stars. Some galaxies are smeared into warped lines of light due to gravitational lensing.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/51194452120/in/photolist-2kZSX2A-2ojjFHZ,,0.7,407,2,0
c86,Caldwell 86,"Hubble captured this close-up view of the star cluster Caldwell 86 in 2005. C86 is about 7,800 light-years away in the constellation Ara. It’s one of the nearest globular clusters to Earth, and it’s estimated to be a staggering 13.4 billion years old. Since the universe itself is roughly 13.8 billion years old, the stars in C86 are some of our galaxy’s first homesteaders.","Several blue and white stars with diffraction spikes crowd the field of view, shining against black space.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/49214155501/in/photolist-2777nTK-28ouTV7-2hYQECF-2hYTpQr-2jWa6e5,peak color and size needs work,0.99,2083,1,0
monkeyhead,Monkey's Head Nebula,"Also known as NGC 2174, this image of the Monkey’s Head Nebula was imaged for Hubble’s 24th anniversary in 2014. This infrared view shows a roiling region of starbirth approximately 6,400 light-years away. Ultraviolet light from the newly formed stars near the center of this nebula help to carve the dust into giant pillars.","Massive clouds of brown, gray, and blue dust fill the image, coalescing into giant, sideways pillars and peaks. Several bright stars shine throughout.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/27414027304/in/photolist-CHijmE-FSHLcn-HLu4eb-ZMEi74-ZPgMoP-2iwZzpo,,0.98,622,2,0
m94,M94,"Messier 94 is a spiral galaxy located about 16 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici. This Hubble image shows M94 at visible and near-infrared wavelengths of light. New stars are forming at a high rate within the galaxy’s bright ring, known as a “starburst” ring.","The bright yellow core of a galaxy is seen at center-left of the image, surrounded by swirling dark brown dust. Beyond the dust is a blue starburst ring, also laced through with dark brown dust.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/35651134244/in/photolist-KmA1MN-Wjno9m-2hNvR5e-2pCR6UV,,0.7,591,2,0
messier4,Messier 4,"Located in the constellation Scorpius, the globular star cluster Messier 4 is about 5,500 light-years away from Earth. M4 is the closest globular cluster to us, and it’s home to more than 100,000 stars. Hubble captured this view in both visible and near-infrared light, offering a view into the center of a cluster that’s more than twice the age of our solar system.","A huge cluster of stars shines against black space, more closely concentrated at center. The stars have diffraction spikes and shine in shades of blue, white, and orange.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/36231597941/in/album-72157687169041265,used minimum filter ,0.95,1067,1,0
n44,N44,"N44 is a complex nebula filled with glowing hydrogen gas, dark lanes of dust, massive stars, and many populations of stars of different ages. It’s an emission nebula, which means that its gas has been energized by the radiation of nearby stars. Located about 170,000 light-years away, N44 spans about 1,000 light-years.","This image is full of orange, white, and blue stars. Glowing clouds of blue and white take up most of the lower portions of the image, and form a giant ring around a dark region of stars near the top.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahubble/51636585444/in/photolist-ZxuUZJ-2mEWZRW,,0.95,1080,2,0
